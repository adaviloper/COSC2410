Virtual Memory:

DEF: isolation between processes. 
	virtual memory may be larger than physical memory size
	*illusion* of contiguous memory

Division of memory (phys & virtual)
	Page - blocks of contiguous data in virtual space
	Frame - Physical memory that holds exactly on page

-Size of page = size of frame

addresses in virtual space are contiguous, but pages are mapped into arbitrary frames.

Converting virtual to physical address handled entirely by Memory Management Unit (MMU)
	Process is called "translation"

Frame and page will have same offset for specific data
Page table maps virtual address to physical address
	stored in RAM


TLB - Translation Lookaside Buffer
	Stores recently used page table entries
